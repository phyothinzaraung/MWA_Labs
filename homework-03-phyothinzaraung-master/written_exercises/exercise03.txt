What is the best way to handle CPU-intensive tasks in Node?

Although Node.js has hidden threads, we cannot use them to offload CPU-intensive tasks such as complex calculations, image resizing, or
video compression. If we do this operations in main thread, it will block the other operations until it is done.

The way to solve this problem is to put those CPU intensive tasks to worker thread. 
For example, if we have a server task that needs to calculate heavy crypto computation. If we do this on main thread (even loop), that 
essentially block my event loop and my server is not able to process other tasks. So, when we move this task to worker thread, the server 
will be responsive and able to process other tasks and requests.

We can process any custom CPU-intensive task in many ways: 
• Cloning Child Process
• Using Worker Threads
