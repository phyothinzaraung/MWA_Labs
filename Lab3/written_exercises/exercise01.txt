Explain in detail Node thread system?

Node.js runs javascript code in single thread, that means one task can process at a time. However, Node.js itself is multi-threaded and
provides hidden threads through "libuv" library which include Event Loop (Main Thread) and Threadpool.

The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.
ref: node.js doc

Node IO thread pool is multi-threaded execution model where threads are pre-allocated and kept on hold until a thread is needed, and saving
the overhead of thread allocation. It's the fastest way to run multi-threaded code. A thread executes one task and when it is done, return to
the pool and back on hold.

The default number of pre-allocated pool is 4 worker thread.
